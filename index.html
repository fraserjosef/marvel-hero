	<h2 align="center">Origin</h2>
	<p>Star Lord, AKA Peter Quill, was born on Earth. His mother died of brain cancer and his father left before Peter was born. Quill ran away and was collected by <a href="http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Yondu_Udonta" target="_blank">Yondu</a>. Yondu raised him and used him for smuggling. Star Lord has no powers so he uses his dual blasters, rocket boots, grenades, and a mask that allows him to breath in space.</p>
	<h2 align="center">Characteristics</h2>
	<p>Star Lord has short, brown hair. He has brown eyes, and usually wears something dark red. He makes puns and jokes all the time. He is usually intelligent but sometimes makes stupid decisions. He's good with most weapons and listens to Oldies' music.</p>
	<h2 align="center">Acquaintances and Affiliations</h2>
	<p>Star Lord is the leader of an inter-galactic team called the <a href="http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Guardians_of_the_Galaxy" target="_blank">Guardians of the Galaxy</a>. That consists of Star Lord, <a href="http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Gamora" target="_blank">Gamora</a>, <a href="http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Drax" target="_blank">Drax the Destroyer</a>, <a href="http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Rocket_Raccoon" target="_blank">Rocket Raccoon</a>, and <a href="http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Groot" target="_blank"> Groot</a>. It has been known to change though. Rocket Raccoon and Peter argue a LOT. Gamora and him have some "unspoken thing" between them. He is also known to work with the <a href="http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Yondu_Ravager_Clan" target="_blank">Yondu Raveger Clan</a>, which is one of the hundreds of Raveger clans. The Yondu Raveger Clan consists of Yondu, <a href="http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Kraglin_Obfonteri" target="_blank">Kraglin</a>, and many, many, more.</p>
